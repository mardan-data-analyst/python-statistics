The histogram divides the values from a sorted dataset into intervals, also called bins. Often, all bins are of equal width, though this doesn’t have to be the case. The values of the lower and upper bounds of a bin are called the bin edges.\n",

By convention, all bins but the rightmost one are half-open. They include the values equal to the lower bounds, but exclude the values equal to the upper bounds. The rightmost bin is closed because it includes both bounds. If you divide a dataset with the bin edges 0, 5, 10, and 15, then there are three bins:\n",
